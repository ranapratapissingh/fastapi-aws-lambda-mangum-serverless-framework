FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

**Documentation**: <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com" target="_blank">https://fastapi.tiangolo.com</a>

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).

* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.

Mangum is an adapter for using [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) applications with AWS Lambda & API Gateway. It is intended to provide an easy-to-use, configurable wrapper for any ASGI application deployed in an AWS Lambda function to handle API Gateway requests and responses.

***Documentation***: https://mangum.io/

## Features

- API Gateway support for [HTTP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html), [REST](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-rest-api.html), and [WebSocket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api.html) APIs.

- Multiple storage backend interfaces for managing WebSocket connections.

- Compatibility with ASGI application frameworks, such as [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and [Quart](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart/). 

- Support for binary media types and payload compression in API Gateway.

- Works with existing deployment and configuration tools, including [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) and [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html).

- Startup and shutdown [lifespan](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/lifespan.html) events.

# Serverless

**The Serverless Framework** â€“ Build applications comprised of microservices that run in response to events, auto-scale for you, and only charge you when they run. This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.

The Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.
